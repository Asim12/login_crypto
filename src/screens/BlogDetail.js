                                    Let’s start this Bitcoin for dummies guide from the basis. Bitcoin has born as an
                                    alternative payment system, also considered as the first cryptocurrency.<a href="">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>
                                    developed Bitcoin as a decentralised alternative to the traditional financial
                                    infrastructure. <a href="">Bitcoin’s whitepaper, released back in 2008</a>, is a must-read for everyone
                                    that really want to understand what Bitcoin represents in modern days.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                As a beginner, you do not need to understand the technicalities of Bitcoin to use it.These
                                are the two most important aspects to keep in mind.
                                </p>

                                The network is fully decentralised.That means that all transactions are publicly
                                accessible, and there is no central body that validates or manages the confirmations.
                                You can read more about Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm here.

                                Bitcoin’s supply is fixed.There will only ever be 21 million coins available on the
                                market, introducing an element of scarcity that adds significant value to the network.

                                <p>
                                Despite the information going around on the media about the volatility of cryptocurrencies,
                                Bitcoin is more secure compared to some financial systems.The underlying technology, known
                                as the blockchain, is a public and decentralised ledger secured by cryptography.Anyone can
                                submit or validate a transaction with no censorship, as long as the participants respect the
                                rules of the network.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Once a miner validates a block, all included transactions are virtually impossible to
                                reverse.The more blocks follow the initial confirmation, the harder to manipulate those
                                transactions.
                                </p>

                                Bitcoin’s network is designed to validate blocks every ten minutes.That is an average
                                target.When sending a transaction, the network asks to indicate the max fee you are willing
                                to pay to have the transaction confirmed.As miners have the incentive to mine blocks to
                                collect the transactions fees, the higher the fee you commit to paying, the quicker will be
                                the confirmations.
                                </p>

                                Decentralisation and the lack of a middleman managing the transactions mean that you are

                                Always double-check the network you are using to make sure the destination wallet is on
                                the same chain.Sending funds on the wrong network, such as sending Bitcoins to an
                                Etheruem-based address, will lead to a loss of your coins.

                                permanent loss.Unless if you know the recipient, you might never recover the extra
                                coins you sent.

                                There are various ways that you can store Bitcoin.Most beginners rely on exchanges to store
                                their funds, but safety is dependent on the exchange’s security infrastructure.Exchanges
                                are often hacked, and there is rarely safety insurance to protect your funds.For this
                                reason, consider storing the coins only on large exchanges with a strong reputation.Also,
                                if you are a long-term investor, holding coins on an exchange should be considered a
                                temporary option, especially if you don’t make frequent transactions.
