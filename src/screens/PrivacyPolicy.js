                Logic Crypto provides all primary rights to the user or data
                subject. Right of objection is also provided by the European
                legislator to all users. It is based on some points of GDPR that
                involve taking an act on the processing of the user’s data.
                After the activity of the data subject, the process of personal
                data will not proceed. Without we are affirmative for the

                Moreover, data subject use their right of objection if we
                process their data for direct marketing. Then, we are

                our users are independent in all circumstances of the use of
                information society services.

              <p>The constraint of Processing Freedom</p>
              <p>
                Here, this is the right of data subjects to restrict the
                processing of data whenever they want. It consists of some other
                rights like stopping processing, finding accuracy, deleting data
                or information. The data subjects also have the facility to hold
                data for a long time. But the controllers sometimes need that
                data for processing or some other exercises. The right of the
                restriction of the process is only applicable when it is
                according to the GDPR.
              </p>
              <p>Data Protection Approval Right</p>

                protection and security approval at any moment so that the
                procedure of the data subject will proceed without any delay.
                The process of availing permission of data protection is the
                same as other rights availing. The data subject can call our
                controller any time to withdraw his or her right.

                Protection of Data while using Facebook
              </h4>

              <p>
                We are also available on Facebook that is a social network. On
                the internet, social networks are used for online communication
                to talk or communicate with other people or organizations. Users
                can give and get many opinions, suggestions, or experimental
                examples for professional and business terms and use. On our
                Facebook page, you can create your personal account to access
                our data and information. Also, social media provides the
                options to create profiles and to upload or save photos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Facebook always detects the clicks that are known as call-up
                actions from the people. Then, Facebook provides these call-up
                acts to the searched sites. People can go to the Facebook pages
                to take a view on it and they can like the post that gives some
                information or attraction to them. After this, Facebook alerts
                the owners of the interested site to provide useful information
                to the people.
              </p>
              <p>
                In short terms, a data subject or user comes to Facebook,
                creates an account, and then searches for interesting topics and
                points. Liking and commenting always depends on the data
                subjects, and then they have an option to log out of their
                account if they want. Facebook provides all the data protection
                guidelines on its page. It is sure that your data will never use
                for any purpose about which you do not know.

                pictures and videos. The platform is for everyone to publish the
                latest ideas and content to the whole world. Users, after
                creating an account like Facebook can search for anything they
                want to. However, users or data subjects also like and comment
                freely on any picture and video.
              </p>
              <p>
                Administrations of Instagram go through the whole search and
                inform all professional accounts that how many users searched
                for their pages or post. Data subjects who searched our account
                heads notify us of the number of searches made in a week or a
                month. Instagram remote features show users in which they are
                interested. Through the information on our posts, data subjects
                can visit our website. On creating the Instagram account all the
                data is saved in Instagram and our site but, it will never be
                used or delivered to any other person or organization. It is our
                privacy policy Instagram also creates its privacy policy which

                The controller is linked with the LinkedIn elements and gets
                informed with the latest news and objectives. These days
                LinkedIn plug-in is also usable on many websites. In this

                as Tweets and are shown to all followers. Moreover, the users of
                Twitter are allowed to use various features like links and hash
                tags. As discussed above, there are the same functions of
                detection that are sent to the controllers of the organizations.
                Twitter is a beneficial platform for both the users and the
